# Computer Networks

This repository contains a set of **4 assignments** completed for the **CS425: Computer Networks** course at **IIT Kanpur**, guided by *Prof. Adithya Vadapalli* (Jan '25 ‚Äì Apr '25).  
Each assignment explores a fundamental networking concept, implemented from the ground up in **C++** and **Python**.
